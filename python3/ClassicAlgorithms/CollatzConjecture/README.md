Collatz's Conjecture states the following as yet unproven(and hence its status as conjecture) hypothosis:

Given any natural number > 1, apply the following two proccesses to it:
if the number is Odd: multiply it by three and add one
if the numer is Even: divide the number by two

This process is then repeated on the result.

The conjecture states that all natural numbers > 1 eventually resolve to 1 through this process.
